# KeenOn Card Compose Service - Implementation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the improvements made to the KeenOn Card Compose service and how to use them effectively.

## Overview of Improvements

The KeenOn Card Compose service has been enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Docker and Container Configuration**
   - Multi-stage builds in Dockerfile
   - Non-root user implementation
   - Resource limits and health checks
   - Docker Compose configuration

2. **Security and Secret Management**
   - Docker secrets implementation
   - Secure environment variable handling
   - SSL/TLS configuration

3. **Networking and Load Balancing**
   - Nginx reverse proxy configuration
   - Network segmentation
   - Rate limiting

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Health check implementation
   - Logging configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenSSL (for generating SSL certificates)
- Bash shell

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd orchestrator-repo/services/keenOn-card-compose
   ```

2. **Generate SSL certificates**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./generate-ssl-certs.sh
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Create .env file**:
   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start the service**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Verify the service is running**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ./scripts/health-check.sh
   ```

## Security Best Practices

### Secret Management

The service uses Docker secrets for sensitive information:

1. **API Keys and Encryption Keys**:
   - Stored in the `secrets/` directory
   - Mounted as read-only files in the container
   - Accessed via environment variables with `_FILE` suffix

2. **Secret Rotation**:
   - Update the secret files
   - Restart the service with `docker-compose restart`

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Use a proper secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault
   - Never commit real secrets to version control
   - Consider using environment-specific secrets

### SSL/TLS Configuration

The Nginx configuration includes:

1. **Modern TLS Settings**:
   - TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 only
   - Strong cipher suites
   - HSTS headers

2. **Certificate Management**:
   - Development: Self-signed certificates generated by the script
   - Production: Use certificates from a trusted CA

## Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes:

1. **Service Configuration**:
   - App service with production target
   - Nginx service for reverse proxy

2. **Networking**:
   - Backend network (internal)
   - Frontend network (exposed)

3. **Resource Limits**:
   - CPU and memory limits
   - Reservations for guaranteed resources

4. **Health Checks**:
   - Regular health checks for the app service
   - Dependency conditions for service startup order

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Health Checks**:
   - Docker health checks
   - External health check script

2. **Logging**:
   - JSON-formatted logs
   - Size and rotation limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service fails to start**:
   - Check logs with `docker-compose logs app`
   - Verify environment variables in `.env` file
   - Check health check script output

2. **Nginx returns 502 Bad Gateway**:
   - Verify app service is running
   - Check Nginx logs with `docker-compose logs nginx`
   - Ensure app service is healthy

3. **SSL certificate issues**:
   - Regenerate certificates with the script
   - Check certificate paths in Nginx configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Monitoring**:
   - Add Prometheus metrics
   - Create Grafana dashboards

2. **Implement Backup and Recovery**:
   - Create backup scripts
   - Test recovery procedures

3. **Implement Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Create Terraform configurations
   - Automate deployment

## Conclusion

The improvements made to the KeenOn Card Compose service have enhanced its security, reliability, and maintainability. By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can ensure the service operates effectively in both development and production environments.
